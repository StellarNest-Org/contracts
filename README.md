# <img src="assets/logo.svg" width="32" height="32" align="center" alt="" /> StellarNest — Contracts

Soroban smart contracts powering **StellarNest**, a family financial
coordination platform on Stellar. Instead of a joint bank account or a
shared spreadsheet, a family gets one programmable treasury: shared
savings, bill automation, spend approvals, and inheritance — all enforced
on-chain, not by convention or a support team's goodwill.

> One treasury. One family. Infinite trust.

This repo contains a single contract, `treasury`, plus the tooling to
build, test, and deploy it. It's one of three StellarNest repos:

| Repo | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`contracts`](https://github.com/StellarNest-Org/contracts) *(this repo)* | The Soroban `treasury` contract |
| [`backend`](https://github.com/StellarNest-Org/backend) | GraphQL API, Postgres data layer, non-custodial Stellar integration |
